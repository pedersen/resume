Dear Prospective Employer:

As an IT professional with over 20 years of experience, I can offer your firm a diverse set of skills in:

* Dramatically improving performance with key enhancements and effective streamlining
* Easily mastering and applying new technologies for an organization’s strategic benefit
* Delivering mission-critical projects with substantial bottom-line impact, ensuring client satisfaction

My recent successes at Pulsepoint illustrate that I can achieve high-impact, cost-effective solutions. Recent career highlights include:

* Migrating workloads between data centers.
* Keeping my team together through COVID-19.

The combination of my strong technical skills and focused drive has ensured that project goals were not only met but consistently exceeded. 

My experience has taught me that technical skill alone cannot guarantee success. I have also developed – and can offer to your firm – qualities of leadership, flexibility, dedication to excellence and the critical ability to work productively with others in challenging situations.

I welcome the opportunity to speak with you further about how my skills and background could bring real advantage to your company’s upcoming, strategic projects.
