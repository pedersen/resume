Re: Position

Dear Prospective Employer:

As a developer / administrator with over 15 years of experience, I can
offer your firm a diverse set of skills in:

* Dramatically improving performance with key enhancements and effective
streamlining
* Providing innovative web solutions for major market advantage
* Easily mastering and applying new technologies for an organization’s
strategic benefit
* Delivering mission-critical projects with substantial bottom-line
impact, ensuring client satisfaction

My recent successes at OrcaTec, as well as 6th Avenue Electronics,
illustrates that I can achieve high-impact, cost-effective solutions.
Recent career highlights include:

* Migrating between ERP platforms in 3 months
* Enabling new revenue stream by providing accurate client usage data
* Data transformation between proprietary format and ODBC compatible
format
* Optimizing performance of monitoring systems, making them responsive

The combination of my strong technical skills and focused drive has
ensured that project goals were not only met but consistently exceeded.

My experience has taught me that technical skill alone cannot guarantee
success. I have also developed – and can offer to your firm – qualities
of leadership, flexibility, dedication to excellence and the critical
ability to work productively with others in challenging situations.

I welcome the opportunity to speak with you further about how my skills
and background could bring real advantage to your company’s upcoming,
strategic projects.

Please feel free to contact me directly at 908-718-1337 or via email at
