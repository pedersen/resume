* Ran, and later automated, nightly code compilations for patient records program. This effort saved approximately 1000 developer hours per week. Before this effort, corrupted nightly compilations stopped the whole team until resolved (usually an entire day would be lost). After this effort, no corrupted compilations occurred for over six months.
* Revamped and improved scripts used by developers for retrieving the nightly code compilations and to perform their own personal compiles, providing new features as requested.
* Wrote several smaller scripts related to the compilation process, to help developers understand what would be required for their work to be completed.
* Researched/corrected error in [Perl][PERL], permitting resolution of time-zone conversion issues, enabling global use of data from medical care providers.
* Created [Perl][PERL] scripts to migrate health care provider data between systems.
* Integrated [AIX][AIX]/[Solaris][SOLARIS] servers into [Windows][WINDOWS] NT network, allowing developers on [Windows][WINDOWS] to access [AIX][AIX]/[Solaris][SOLARIS] files/printers.
* Developed a set of [Solaris][SOLARIS] packages allowing deployment of new servers within 2 hours of receipt.
* Developed [Ghost][GHOST]-like utility overnight, meeting next-morning deadline for usable computer loads.
* Configured several Sun Ultra servers to work as part of a network. Original condition was such that they were on a network, but not working together. This involved re-mapping user id numbers, and configuring NFS mounts such that the machines worked together.
* Configured and administered a [CVS][CVS] repository.
* Created a set of [Solaris][SOLARIS] packages to allow the deployment of new [Solaris][SOLARIS] servers within 2 hours of receiving them.
* Coded many scripts to perform several daily tasks.
* Downloaded and tested new tools to be used for the compilation process, to make sure they still produced correct results.
* Installed [Perl][PERL] modules and programs as requested by developers.
* Documented all new scripts and processes, and informed developers when new documents were available.
* Participated in configuration of training room using [Red Hat Linux][REDHAT] with [Kickstart][RHKS].
* Assisted customers in resolution of issues with [Windows][WINDOWS] 95, [Windows][WINDOWS] NT, Microsoft Office, and other software packages in use throughout Coors.
* Instructed junior developers in the inner workings of C++.
