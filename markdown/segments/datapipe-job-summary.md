Datapipe manages thousands of customers servers. Many of these servers are connected to various shared storage systems, including [3Par][3PAR], [Isilon][ISILON], and backup servers. Datapipe required an ability to do reporting on what data was being stored on these systems for each client, and then report that data back to billing. In addition, Datapipe required monitoring of the backup systems to ensure timely and complete backups of client data. My duties primarily focused on making these systems work well.

My team structure is worth describing briefly as well: My immediate manager worked out of Austin, TX. One coworker worked in the same building as myself, and I had two "extended" teammates who worked in Jersey City, NJ (I worked in Somerset, NJ). The extended team included the [Windows][WINDOWS] developers, while I was on the UNIX development team.
