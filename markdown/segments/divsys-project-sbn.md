**Company**  Diversified Systems

[SBN][SBN], published by IBSoft, is an ERP system for the alarm industry. Diversified Systems is a subcontractor working in the low voltage electrical industry, including alarm systems, stereo systems, central intercom systems, structured wiring, and central vacuum systems. I implemented all aspects of [SBN][SBN] at Diversified Systems.

The provided client interface was unsuited for the intended use. This resulted in much in-house development to augment the [SBN][SBN] client with a web-based interface.

* Configured all aspects of [SBN][SBN] from base installation to full production mode, with active communication with users at each step.
* Implemented over 50 custom screens and reports using [PHP][PHP] on an [Apache][APACHE] web server. This included easier access to customer searches, more usable technician schedules, and easier input for large quantities of data.
* Developed automated system for the sending of faxes to field technicians,saving over 5 work hours per day.
* Implemented an automated backup system for the database.
* Administered [Sybase][SYBASE] instance on day to day basis, resolving issues with full log files, etc.
