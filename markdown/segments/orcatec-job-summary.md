OrcaTec is in the litigation support industry (they help their clients reduce the costs of being sued). OrcaTec is primarily a software-as-a-service company, allowing OrcaTec to host customer data. While working here, my focus has been on improving the GUI. This has involved refactoring code heavily, adding new features, and adding new tests to cover existing and new code.

The team structure at OrcaTec is geographically very diverse. In addition to my own telecommuting, I have teammates in many states. We all work remotely, and we all work together to make the product the best that it can be.
