IBM was under contract to develop a complete clinical information system for Kaiser Permanente clinics. I participated as a member of the environment team, focusing on improving the build processes.

* Resolved issues with corrupted builds occurring weekly, resulting in savings of over 1000 work hours every week.
* Developed and improved approximately 450 compilation scripts and Makefiles on [AIX][AIX] and [Windows][WINDOWS] NT/2000, fixing dependency issues and allowing reliable use of nightly code compilations.
* Evaluated, tested, integrated, and deployed new compilation tools.
