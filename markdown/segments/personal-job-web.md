* Studying Android application development at [Udacity.com][UDACITY].
* Starting in 2009, I began participating in the [TurboGears][TG] project, working primarily on the documentation. In 2011 and 2012, I was the lead project maintainer, and we put out three releases in 2011 alone. As of now, I still manage the server and DNS for [turbogears.org][TG], with work on documentation, bug fixing, new features, and mailing list management, as time permits.
* Created [Java][JAVA] plugin for [Openfire XMPP][OPENFIRE] server, allowing [vBulletin][VB] forums to have a working XMPP server for their communities.

* Customized installation of [Request Tracker][RT] for San Diego firm.
* Contributed patch to [Mercurial][HG] to assist with repository conversions. Specifically, it allows branches to be renamed (useful for repositories that used named branches in [Subversion][SVN] to change their main trunk location).
