# Summary

I'm a manager with 5 years of experience guiding teams through challenging conditions, ranging from technical challenges through COVID-19 related challenges. I have kept my team together, and we have thrived on the challenges of taking care of the data for a $200 million company.

Furthermore, as a DevOps Engineer, I have 23 years of experience managing Linux, UNIX, [Windows][WINDOWS], and OSX/macOS systems. This means that I look at the whole picture, not just System Administration or Software Development. Shepherding a system through the creation and deployment process, and seeing the customer's happiness at having things work the way they need it to, is a particular joy of mine. Making people's lives better is the point of technology, after all.

I am comfortable in a wide range of working conditions. Work environments have been heterogeneous (several flavors of Linux, [Windows][WINDOWS], and OSX/macOS), small to medium sized (from 10 to 1200 servers, 20 to 300 workstations), and mixed locations (all local to all remote teams). Programming languages have included Python, PHP, Perl, and Java.
