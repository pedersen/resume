            <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
            <p>With a 28 year career, I have filled a variety of technical roles. As a manager, I have spent 5 years of
            my career guiding teams through challenging conditions, ranging from technical challenges through COVID-19
            related challenges. I have kept my team together, and we have thrived on the challenges of taking care of
            the data for a $200 million company. This includes managing my team through the COVID-19 pandemic, without
            losing a single member of my team to another company.</p>
            <p>I am a <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/6c91d726-a924-4b8d-994b-80e49e002428/public_url">Google
            Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer</a>. I have spent 9 years working with streaming challenges, ETL
            challenges, and data latency challenges as we keep our overall latency to 5 hours or less. We have done this
            using <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a
            href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>, and <a href="https://www.alluxio.io/">Alluxio</a>. We have
            worked with different data storage formats, different compute engines for accessing the data, and different
            ways to coordinate our ETL pipeline to avoid having jobs crash into each other.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as a DevOps Engineer, I have 23 years of experience managing Linux, UNIX, <a
            href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/">Windows</a>, and OSX/macOS systems. This means that I look
            at the whole picture, not just System Administration or Software Development. Shepherding a system through
            the creation and deployment process, and seeing the customer’s happiness at having things work the way they
            need it to, is a particular joy of mine. Making people’s lives better is the point of technology, after
            all.</p>
            <p>Finally, as a Software Engineer, I have spent 6 years of my career focused on delivering high quality
            software to my company’s customers, with their focus and needs being on sorting through large numbers of
            documents in a timely fashion. This has meant understanding ingestion, storage, and display of arbitrary
            data. It has included custom data visualizations. This was primarily done with <a
            href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a>, but has also
            included work with <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.</p>
            <p>I am comfortable in a wide range of working conditions. Work environments have been heterogeneous
            (several flavors of Linux, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/">Windows</a>, and OSX/macOS),
            small to medium sized (from 10 to 1200 servers, 20 to 300 workstations), and mixed locations (all local to
            all remote teams). Programming languages have included Python, PHP, Perl, and Java.</p>

            sale system and become the IT Manager. At the time the point of sale transition was completed, we had a team
            of 6 people managing the servers and about 300 desktops.</p>

            <p>Jersey City, NJ - May 2008 - Jan 2011</p>
            <p>Datapipe manages thousands of customers servers. Many of these servers are connected to various shared
            storage systems, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3PAR">3Par</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_EMC_Isilon">Isilon</a>, and backup servers. Datapipe required an
            ability to do reporting on what data was being stored on these systems for each client, and then report that
            data back to billing. In addition, Datapipe required monitoring of the backup systems to ensure timely and
            complete backups of client data. My duties primarily focused on making these systems work well.</p>
            <p>My team structure is worth describing briefly as well: My immediate manager worked out of Austin, TX. One
            coworker worked in the same building as myself, and I had two “extended” teammates who worked in Jersey
            City, NJ (I worked in Somerset, NJ). The extended team included the <a

            <li>Developed multi-threaded back end daemon (in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>) which
            connected to the various storage systems and gathered the data about the stored data for reporting before
            pushing aggregate data to the billing system.</li>
            <li>Developed web interface that would allow users to drill down and see how storage was being used (by
            client, by server, by data center, and/or by storage type).</li>
            <li>Wrote tool to gather performance data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3PAR">3Par</a> InServ

            <p>Decision Consultants (DCI) was acquired by Ciber, Inc., in 2002. While working for DCI, I was contracted
            out to Coors, IBM, and a .com named “X-Care” (no longer in business). The points below come from all of
            those places.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Ran, and later automated, nightly code compilations for patient records program. This effort saved
            approximately 1000 developer hours per week. Before this effort, corrupted nightly compilations stopped the
            whole team until resolved (usually an entire day would be lost). After this effort, no corrupted
            compilations occurred for over six months.</li>
            <li>Revamped and improved scripts used by developers for retrieving the nightly code compilations and to
            perform their own personal compiles, providing new features as requested.</li>
            <li>Wrote several smaller scripts related to the compilation process, to help developers understand what
            would be required for their work to be completed.</li>

            were on a network, but not working together. This involved re-mapping user id numbers, and configuring NFS
            mounts such that the machines worked together.</li>

            <p>Pulsepoint is in the process of migrating between data centers. A significant portion of the existing
            hardware has gone past its end of life, so we chose to build a new data center, with new hardware. At the
            same time, we used the latest versions of all relevant software that we could (<a
            href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, etc).</p>
            <p>This provided us with an opportunity to fix some design flaws in the original big data clusters, and we
            used this chance to make things better for us overall.</p>
            <p>The work remaining at this point comes down to verifying that the new versions of the ETL jobs function
            as expected, producing valid output. The process is expected to complete in 2025.</p>

            <p>Pulsepoint built the entire ETL pipeline using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> 2. On January
            1, 2020, Python 2 reached its end of life. In order for the ETL pipeline to continue to grow, we needed to
            migrate to Python 3.</p>
            <p>The path we chose was to extract the code that was common to the pipeline, and turn that code into a
            library. We then began the normal route of making backwards incompatible changes. Because of the scope of
            this work (nearly 200K lines in Python files), and the work being done during a data center migration, the
            project is still ongoing. However, over 50K lines have been successfully completed so far.</p>

            <p>In the end, this was deemed non-feasible for the number of combinations we would have had to provide,

            <p>Pulsepoint needed to establish a disaster recovery site, and had chosen an existing data center to do so.
            In the process, establishing a <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> cluster was required for
            business continuity. My task was to get everything configured to the point that the same data jobs running
            in the primary cluster ran in the backup cluster and provided equivalent data, even though everything was
            running independently.</p>

            <p>At OrcaTec, the primary tool we provided to our customers was the ability to search collections of
            documents quickly. In addition to having simple search tools, we also had a helper tool in the “Advanced
            Search”.</p>
            <p>This tool allowed the user to search based on a dozen different fields, but was still limited and
            fragile. It was unable to help the user build queries which combined different fields in a single clause. In
            addition, it had issues with encoding &lt;&gt; in email addresses, and did not support drag and drop on all
            of our supported browsers.</p>
            <p>When this project was completed, this tool had transformed noticeably. It now is its own miniature
            investigative tool, allowing customers to easily search through collections of documents. One customer
            reported narrowing their searches from 80,000 possible documents down to under 2,000 within an hour through
            use of this tool. Due to extensive test coverage when the code was published, even the problems that were
            found were quickly fixable. All of this was accomplished while reducing the total code for it by 50%.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Debugged issues with drag/drop on mobile browsers.</li>

            href="https://pypi.org/project/Paste/">Paster</a> (in many instances, loading up documents that were over

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_EMC_Isilon">Isilon</a>, and backup servers. Datapipe required an
            ability to do reporting on what data was being stored on these systems for each client, and then report that
            data back to billing. StorageWeb was written to fill that need.</p>

            <p>Datapipe provides managed hosting for its clients. This means that customers contact Datapipe to report
            issues on servers, and Datapipe administrators log in to customer machines as root to fix the problems.
            UNIXOps provides a secure method to allow the administrators a one time SSH key to login to the customer
            equipment, along with providing detailed logging of everything the administrator does for later review.</p>

            <p>Due to the costs associated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/index.html">SAP</a>, we had just over three

            <p><a href="https://www.tylernet.com/">Tyler</a> is a point of sale system used by many smaller retail
            establishments. <a href="https://www.tylernet.com/">Tyler</a> stores data in a set of proprietary ISAM
            files. These files do not have a modern access tool available (such as Crystal Reports) to perform
            reporting.</p>
            <p>The users needed an easy way to report on the data, and this meant a tool was needed to copy the data
            from the on-disk files into a formal SQL server of some variety. In less than a month, I wrote a tool in <a
            href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> to read the <a href="https://www.tylernet.com/">Tyler</a> data
            files and load the information into a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database on a
            nightly basis.</p>
            <p>This tool copied the entire database, comprising approximately 36,000,000 records, 140 tables, and 22
            gigabytes of disk space. The program worked by reading the structure definition from the configuration files
            and recreating the structure in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. PyTyler would then
            read each table, row by row, parse the data in the row, and load it into <a
            href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> server.</p>
            <p>This allowed the users to use standard ODBC drivers to access and report on the data.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Developed a tool to read configuration of ISAM files, and generate SQL “create table” statements
            mirroring the structure of the file.</li>
            <li>Created a specialized reader class which could read the data stored in the ISAM table.</li>
            <li>Developed small web server application to provide status page for administrators while migration tool
            runs</li>
            <li>Reduced total run time from 13 hours to 5 hours by converting the entire application into a
            multi-threaded application.</li>
            <li>Verified that data is being copied into the system correctly.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.tylernet.com/">Tyler</a> POS system was in production until the closure of the
            company in December, 2011, so data copy ran every night to bring in updated data from previous day’s
            activities.</li>
